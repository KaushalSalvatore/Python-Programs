#### Q-1 Mention the different types of Data Structures in Pandas?

```bash
Series - It is a one-dimensional array-like structure with homogeneous data which means data of different data types cannot be a part of the same series. It can hold any data type such as integers, floats, and strings
DataFrame - It is a two-dimensional array-like structure with heterogeneous data. It can contain data of different data types and the data is aligned in a tabular manner.
Panel - The Pandas have a third type of data structure known as Panel, which is a 3D data structure capable of storing heterogeneous data but it isnâ€™t that widely used.

import pandas as pd

# a simple dictionary
dict = {'A': 101,
		'B': 202,
		'C': 303}

# create series from dictionary
ser = pd.Series(dict)
Output:

A    101
B    202
C    303

```

#### Q-2 How can we convert Series to DataFrame?
