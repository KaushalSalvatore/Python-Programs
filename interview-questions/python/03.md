#### Q-1 What are python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python?

```bash
os
sys
math
random
data time
JSON

```

#### Q-2 Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language?

```bash
Actually, Python is a partially compiled language and partially interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code internally this byte code gets converted by the Python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system).

```

#### Q-3 What are Access Specifiers in Python?

```bash
Python uses the ‘_’ symbol to determine the access control for a specific data member or a member function of a class.

Public Access Modifier: The members of a class that are declared public are easily accessible from any part of the program. All data members and member functions of a class are public by default. 
Protected Access Modifier: The members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived from it. All data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore ‘_’ symbol before the data members of that class. 
Private Access Modifier: The members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only, the private access modifier is the most secure access modifier. Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore ‘__’ symbol before the data member of that class. 

```

#### Q-4 What is Walrus Operator ?

```bash
The Walrus Operator allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don’t want to repeat the calculation.

The Walrus Operator is represented by the `:=` syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements.

Note: Python versions before 3.8 doesn’t support Walrus Operator.

names = ["Jacob", "Joe", "Jim"]
 
if (name := input("Enter a name: ")) in names:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
else:
    print("Name not found.")
```

#### Q-5 What is __init__ in Python?

```bash
In Python classes, the reserved method init serves a similar purpose as constructors in object-oriented programming (OOP) terminology. When a new object is created, the init method is automatically called, initializing the object and allocating memory for it. This method can also be utilized to set initial values for variables.

class Human:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age
    def say(self):
        print('Hello, my age is', self.age)
h = Human(22)
h.say()

```

#### Q-6 How Would You Remove All Leading Whitespace in a String ?

```bash
“      Python”.lstrip

```

#### Q-7 What Is the Difference Between Del and Remove() on Lists ?

```bash
del : del removes all elements of a list within a given range 
Syntax: del list[start:end]

remove() : remove() removes the first occurrence of a particular character 
Syntax: list.remove(element)
```

#### Q-8 what is Monkey Patching in python ?  

```bash
the term monkey patch refers to dynamic (or run-time) modifications of a class or module. In Python, we can actually change the behavior of code at run-time.

class Greeting:
    def greet(self):
        return 'well Come'

def new_greet(self):
    return 'Hello well come to python'

Greeting.greet = new_greet
g = Greeting()
print(g.greet())

```

#### Q-9 How will you check if a class is a child of another class ?

```bash
This is done by using a method called issubclass() provided by python.

class Parent(object):
   pass   
 
class Child(Parent):
   pass   
 
# Driver Code
print(issubclass(Child, Parent))    #True
print(issubclass(Parent, Child))    #False

```

#### Q-11 What are Dict and List comprehensions?

```bash
x=[i for i in range(5)]
[0,1,2,3,4]

x=[i : i+2 for i in range(5)]
[0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5, 4: 6]

```

#### Q-12 What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?

```bash
The .py files are the python source code files. While the .pyc files contain the bytecode of the python files.
