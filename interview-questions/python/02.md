#### Q-1 What do you mean by ‘suites’ in Python ?

```bash
If expression
Suite
Else
Suite

```

#### Q-2 Difference Between Modules and Packages in Python ?

```bash
Module

The module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file.
import my_module

Package

The package is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package.
from my_package.abc import a

```

#### Q-3 How Exception Handled In Python ?

```bash

Try: This block will test the exceptional error to occur.

Except: Here you can handle the error.

Else: If there is no exception then this block will be executed.

Finally: Finally block always gets executed either exception is generated or not.

try:
      # Some Code....!

except:
      # Optional Block
      # Handling of exception (if required)

else:
      # Some code .....
      # execute if no exception

finally:
      # Some code .....(always executed)

```

#### Q-4 How to use F String and Format or Replacement Operator ?
 
```bash

name = 'Nitin'
role = 'Python Developer'
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {role}")
print(("Hello, My name is {} and I'm {}").format(name,role))
```

#### Q-5 Does Python Support Multiple Inheritance. (Diamond Problem) ?

```bash 

class A:
	def abc(self):
		print("a")

class B(A):
	def abc(self):
		print("b")

class C(A):
	def abc(self):
		print("c")

class D(B,C):
	pass

d = D()
d.abc()

Output:
b

```

#### Q-6 How to initialize Empty List, Tuple, Dict and Set? 
```bash 
Empty List:
a = []

Empty Tuple:
a = ()

Empty Dict:
a = {}

Empty Set:
a = set()

```

#### Q-7 How Slicing Works In String Manipulation. Explain.
```bash 
Syntax: Str_Object[Start_Position:End_Position:Step]

Indexing
print(s[:])  #HelloWorld
print(s[::])  #HelloWorld
print(s[:5])  #Hello
print(s[2:5])  #llo
print(s[2:8:2])  #loo
print(s[8:1:-1])  #lroWoll
print(s[-4:-2])  #or
print(s[::-1])  #dlroWolleH
```

#### Q-8  What Is _a, __a,  __a__ in Python?

```bash
_a : Python doesn't have real private methods, so one underline in the beginning of a variable/function/method name means it's a private variable/function/method and It is for internal use only

__a : Main purpose for __ is to use variable/method in class only If you want to use it outside of the class you can make public api.

__a__ : Name with start with __ and ends with same considers special methods in Python. 
```

#### Q-9 Difference Between Anonymous and Lambda Function

```bash
Anonymous function:
In Python, Anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.
While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, Anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.
Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

Lambda function:
It can have any number of arguments but only one expression. 
The expression is evaluated and returned. 
Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.

```

#### Q-10 Explain Append() And Extend() Property Of List ? 

```bash 
Append():
append() adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. 
The length of the list itself will increase by one.

Extend():
extend() concatenates the first list with another list/iterable.
extend() iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list.

Consider 2 Lists - List1 & List2


list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = [5,6,7]

Append():.

list1.append('AB')
print(list1)

Output:
[1, 2, 3, 'AB’]

Extend():.


list1.extend(‘AB’)
print(list1)

Output:
[1, 2, 3, ‘A’, ‘B’]

Append():.

list1.append(list2)
print(list1)

Output:
[1, 2, 3, [5, 6, 7]]

Extend():.


list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

Output:
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

```

#### Q-11 Why Python Is Called As Dynamic Typed Programming Language OR What Is Duck Typing?

```bash
The "Duck typing" name comes from the phrase, “If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” 

Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. 
It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. 


```

#### Q-12 What Is MRO In Python
 
```bash
In this case, the MRO would be C -> B -> A.
Since B was mentioned first in class declaration, it will be searched first while resolving a method.
MRO stands for Method Resolution Order
In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right.
