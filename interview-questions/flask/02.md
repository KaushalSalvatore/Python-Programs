#### Q-3 difference between blueprints and Views. ?

```bash
Blueprints: A Blueprint is a method of organizing a collection of related views and other code. Instead of registering views and other code with an application directly, they are registered with a blueprint. 

Views: The code you write to reply to queries to your application is known as a view function. Flask matches the incoming request URL to the view that should handle it using patterns. Flask converts the data returned by the view into an outgoing response. Flask may also generate a URL for a view depending on its name and arguments in the other direction.

after_request(): They are called after a request and pass the response that will be sent to the client.
teardown_request(): They are called in a situation when an exception is raised and responses are not guaranteed. They are called after the response has been constructed. They are not allowed to modify the request, and their values are ignored.
