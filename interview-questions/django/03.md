#### Q-18 How Can You Combine Multiple QuerySets In A View?

```bash
class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(blank=True)

class Email(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField(blank=True)

Let's suppose the following three querysets generated from above models, that you want to combine.

query_set_1 = Blog.objects.filter(id__gte=3)
query_set_2 = Email.objects.filter(id__lte=11)
query_set_3 = Blog.objects.filter(id__lte=2)

query_set_1 = Blog.objects.filter(id__gte=3)
query_set_2 = Email.objects.filter(id__lte=11)
query_set_3 = Blog.objects.filter(id__lte=2)

1. Using Union Operator:  

combined_result= query_set_1 | query_set_3 | query_set_4 ...

2. Using Itertools:

from itertools import chain 
combined_list = list(chain(query_set_1,query_set_2))

```

#### Q-19 Explain How A Request Is Processed In Django ?

```bash
Here, a user requests for a resource to the Django, Django works as a controller and check to the available resource in URL.
When Django server is started, the manage.py file searches for settings.py file, which contains information of all the applications installed in the project, middleware used, database connections and path to the main urls config.
Manage.py >> Setting.py >> urls.py >> views.py >> models.py >> templates

```
