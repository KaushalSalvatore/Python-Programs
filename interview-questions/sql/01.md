#### Q-1 what is indexing in sql ?

```bash
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries. Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). 
```

#### Q-2 whats is performance tuning in python how it is work ?

```bash 
1. Use list comprehensions.
2. Remember the built-In functions.
3. Use xrange() instead of range().
4. Consider writing your own generator.
5. Avoid global variables.
6. Use “while” for an infinite loop.

```

#### Q-3 what is aggregations database ? 

```bash
In its simplest form, data aggregation is the process of compiling typically [large] amounts of information from a given database and organizing it into a more consumable and comprehensive medium.

```

#### Q-4 whats is seeding in database ? 

```bash
In Django, to seed the data into the database, we can execute a command python manage.py loaddata <file>. The file is the file with the specification of the initial data that we want to store into the database. We can write the data you want to store into the database with the format XML, JSON, or YAML. In our project, we use JSON. Here is an example for the Admin model: 
```

#### Q-5 What is a QuerySet?

```bash
A Query Set is a collection of data from a database. Query set allows us to get data easily, by allowing us to filter, create, order, etc. 

```

#### Q-6 What is the role of a Session in SQLAlchemy and how it is different from the Connection?

```bash
A Session in SQLAlchemy is a workspace for all operations, providing an interface between Python and the database. It holds onto objects until changes are committed to the database. A Connection, on the other hand, is a conduit for raw SQL statements. The key difference lies in their functionality: Sessions manage transactions at ORM level while Connections handle them at core level. In essence, Sessions offer higher-level, Pythonic access to database operations, whereas Connections provide lower-level, direct interaction with the database via SQL.

```
 
#### Q-7 Can you explain the concept of lazy loading in SQLAlchemy?

```bash
Lazy loading in SQLAlchemy is a strategy where related data isn’t loaded from the database until it’s needed. This approach can improve performance by reducing initial load times and memory usage. There are three types of lazy loading: ‘select’, ‘joined’ and ‘subquery’.

```

#### Q-8 What is the role of the MetaData class in SQLAlchemy?

```bash
MetaData in SQLAlchemy serves as a registry for schema constructs like tables. It collects Table objects and provides SQL generation services.
 
```

#### Q-9 What is SQLAlchemy?

```bash
SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides a high-level interface for working with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It offers a powerful ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that makes it easy to work with database objects in Python.

```

#### Q-10 How do you create a database schema using SQLAlchemy?

```bash 
You can create a database schema using SQLAlchemy by using the create_engine() function. This function will create a new database based on the parameters that you specify.

```

#### Q-11 What are some important classes provided by SQLAlchemy to map tables from a database?

```bash
The most important classes provided by SQLAlchemy to map tables from a database are the Table, MetaData, and Column classes. The Table class represents a table in a database, the MetaData class represents the schema for a database, and the Column class represents a column in a database table.

```

#### Q-12 How can you run a query using SQLAlchemy?

```bash 
You can run a query using SQLAlchemy by using the query method on a Session object. This will return a ResultProxy, which you can then use to access the results of the query.
```

#### Q-13 Can you give me an example of how we can get an object representation for data retrieved from a table based on certain criteria?

```bash
We can use the filter() method to get an object representation for data retrieved from a table based on certain criteria.

results = table.filter(table.c.id > 5)

```

#### Q-14 Is it possible to convert a list of objects into a dictionary using SQLAlchemy? If yes, then how?

```bash
Yes, it is possible to convert a list of objects into a dictionary using SQLAlchemy. This can be done using the `as_dict` function.

```

#### Q-15  What is the best way to specify different connection strings for production and testing environments?

```bash
The best way to specify different connection strings for production and testing environments is to use environment variables.

```

#### Q-16 What’s the difference between session.commit() and session.flush()?

```bash
session.commit() will also commit any changes to the database, whereas session.flush() will only flush the changes to the database.

```

#### Q-17 What is the usage of ‘echo’ parameter in configuring SQLAlchemy?

```bash 
The echo parameter is used to print out all of the SQL queries that are being executed by SQLAlchemy. This can be helpful in debugging issues with your code or with SQLAlchemy itself.

```

#### Q-18 What is a declarative base class in SQLAlchemy?

```bash 
A declarative base class is a class that is used to declare the structure of a database table in SQLAlchemy. This class is used to map the columns of a database table to the fields of a Python class.

```

#### Q-19 What are the various types of relationships supported in SQLAlchemy?

```bash 
SQLAlchemy supports four types of relationships: one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

```

#### Q-20 What is difference between null=True and blank=True?

```bash
If null=True means the field value is set as NULL i.e. no data. It is basically for the database column value.
date = models.DateTimeField(null=True)  

The blank = True specifies whether field is required in forms.
title = models.CharField(blank=True) // title can be kept blank. In the database ("") will be stored.  

```
