#### Q-1 How docker is different from standard virtualization using VMs ? 

```bash 
Virtual Machines (VMs) virtualize the underlying hardware. They run on physical hardware via an intermediation layer known as a hypervisor. 
They are more suitable for monolithic applications. Whereas, Docker is operating system level virtualization. Docker containers userspaceace on top the of host kernel, making them lightweight and fast. Up-scaling is simpler. It allows you to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight and portable containers.

```

#### Q-2 What are docker images ?

```bash 
They are executable packages(bundled with application code & dependencies, software packages, etc.) for the purpose of creating containers. Docker images can be deployed to any docker environment and the containers can be spun up there to run the application

```

#### Q-3 Can you tell something about docker container?

```bash     
In simplest terms, docker containers consist of applications and all their dependencies.
Technically, they are just the runtime instances of docker images.
Containers help in running the applications correctly in various computing environments. This helps to resolve the biggest problem “ It doesn’t work in my system. Multiple containers in an isolated manner can co-exist in a host system. All containers share the common host operating system. Thus making the containers lightweight and more preferable than virtual machines.

```

#### Q-4 What is a DockerFile ?

```bash 
docker file ---> Docker Image ----> Docker Container 
```

#### Q-5 Can you tell what is the functionality of a hypervisor?

```bash 
A hypervisor is a software that makes virtualization happen because of which is sometimes referred to as the Virtual Machine Monitor. This divides the resources of the host system and allocates them to each guest environment installed.

Hardware ----> hypervisor ------> (OS1 , OS2 , OS3)
```

#### Q-6 What can you tell about Docker Compose?
```bash 
It is a YAML file consisting of all the details regarding various services, networks, and volumes that are needed for setting up the Docker-based application.

```

#### Q-7 What is the docker command that lists the status of all docker containers ?

```bash 
docker ps -a

```

#### Q-8 What command can you run to export a docker image as an archive?

```bash
docker save -o <exported_name>.tar <container-name>

```

#### Q-9 What command can be run to import a pre-exported Docker image into another Docker host?

```bash 
docker load -i <export_image_name>.tar

```

#### Q-10 Differentiate between virtualization and containerization ? 

```bash 
virtualization :-
This helps developers to run and host multiple OS on the hardware of a single physical server.
Hypervisors provide overall virtual machines to the guest operating systems.

containerization :- 
This helps developers to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
Containers ensure isolated environment/ user spaces are provided for running the applications. Any changes done within the container do not reflect on the host or other containers of the same host.

```

#### Q-11 Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile?

```bash
Both the commands have similar functionality, but COPY is more preferred because of its higher transparency level than that of ADD.
COPY provides just the basic support of copying local files into the container whereas ADD provides additional features like remote URL and tar extraction support.

```

#### Q-12 Can you tell the differences between a docker Image and Layer?

```bash 
Image: This is built up from a series of read-only layers of instructions. An image corresponds to the docker container and is used for speedy operation due to the caching mechanism of each step.

Layer: Each layer corresponds to an instruction of the image’s Dockerfile. In simple words, the layer is also an image but it is the image of the instructions run.

```

#### Q-13 List the most commonly used instructions in Dockerfile?
```bash 
FROM: This is used to set the base image for upcoming instructions. A docker file is considered to be valid if it starts with the FROM instruction.
LABEL: This is used for the image organization based on projects, modules, or licensing. It also helps in automation as we specify a key-value pair while defining a label that can be later accessed and handled programmatically.
RUN: This command is used to execute instructions following it on the top of the current image in a new layer. Note that with each RUN command execution, we add layers on top of the image and then use that in subsequent steps.
CMD: This command is used to provide default values of an executing container. In cases of multiple CMD commands the last instruction would be considered.

```

#### Q-14 Describe the lifecycle of Docker Container?

```bash
Created: This is the state where the container has just been created new but not started yet.
Running: In this state, the container would be running with all its associated processes.
Paused: This state happens when the running container has been paused.
Stopped: This state happens when the running container has been stopped.
Deleted: In this, the container is in a dead state.
 
```

#### Q-15 What is Docker Compose? What can it be used for?

```bash
Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define multiple containers and their configurations via a YAML or JSON file.

The most common use for Docker Compose is when your application has one or more dependencies, e.g., MySQL or Redis. Normally, during development, these dependencies are installed locally

Once set up, you can bring all of these containers/dependencies up and running with a single docker-compose up command.

```

#### Q-16 what are the major components of Docker are daemon ? 

```bash
The four major components of Docker are daemon, Client, Host, and Registry

Docker daemon: It is also referred to as ‘dockerd’ and it accepts Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. It can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

Docker Client: It is the predominant way that enables Docker users to interact with Docker. It sends the docker commands to docked, which actually executes them using Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

Docker Registry: It hosts the Docker images and is used to pull and push the docker images from the configured registry. Docker Hub is the public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. However, it is always recommended for organizations to use own private registry.

Docker Host: It is the physical host (VM) on which Docker Daemon is running and docker images and containers are created.

```

#### Q-17 what is docker volume

```bash
A data volume is a specially-designated directory that is located outside of the root filesystem of a container (i.e. created on the host), designed to persist data, independent of the container’s life cycle. This allows sharing data within containers by importing volume directory in other containers.
Volumes can be initialized when a container is created.
Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.

```

#### Q-18 Explain basic docker workflow ? 

```bash
Everything starts with the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is the source code of the Image.
Once the Dockerfile is created, you build it to create the image of the container. The image is just the "compiled version" of the "source code" which is the Dockerfile.

Once you have the image of the container, you should redistribute it using the registry. The registry is like a git repository -- you can push and pull images.

Next, you can use the image to run containers. A running container is very similar, in many aspects, to a virtual machine (but without the hypervisor).

```

#### Q-19 what are the steps involevd while using docker for application development  ?

```bash 
Create Dockerfile:
Build image:
Run the image:
Start Containers using Compose:
Test the Application:
Push image:
Production orchestration:

```
