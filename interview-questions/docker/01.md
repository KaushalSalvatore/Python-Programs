#### Q-How docker is different from standard virtualization using VMs ? 
```bash 
Virtual Machines (VMs) virtualize the underlying hardware. They run on physical hardware via an intermediation layer known as a hypervisor. 
They are more suitable for monolithic applications. Whereas, Docker is operating system level virtualization. Docker containers userspaceace on top the of host kernel, making them lightweight and fast. Up-scaling is simpler. It allows you to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight and portable containers.
